# Claude Secure Terminal

A secure terminal interface for Claude Desktop with comprehensive security controls, audit logging, and configurable permissions.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Build the extension
./build.sh

# Install to Claude Desktop
# Copy the build/ directory to your Claude extensions folder and restart Claude
```

## üîí What This Extension Does

Claude Secure Terminal allows Claude to execute terminal commands safely with:

- **Security First**: Only whitelisted commands can run
- **Directory Controls**: Commands restricted to allowed directories
- **Audit Logging**: Complete history of all command executions
- **Timeout Protection**: Commands auto-terminate if they run too long
- **Output Limiting**: Prevents system flooding with large outputs

## üì¶ Installation

**Important**: Dependencies are installed only during build, not stored in the repository.

   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/extensions/`
3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. The extension will be automatically loaded
